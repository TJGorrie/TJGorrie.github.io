      <description>After 5 years of being ‘active’ online as a respectable human being I believe that it is now the right time to start a blog and also flesh out what should be a serviceable website to advertise myself.
I am not expecting to post daily but enough to document in an unofficial manner my opinions as I continue my career as a scientist and/or research software engineer. Anyway just a short post to test some stuff.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my website! I am Tyler Gorrie-Stone. I currently work as a Research Software Engineer on i04-1 at Diamond Light Source. Previously I have worked as a Bioinformatician/Computational Biologist in epigenetics.
I love working in R, getting pretty handy at Python and begrundingly have to use JavaScript sometimes (yuck!)</description>
